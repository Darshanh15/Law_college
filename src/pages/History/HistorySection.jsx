              <h3>2009 – Foundation</h3>
              <p>
                Established as <strong>R.K. Law College</strong>, with a vision
                to provide affordable and quality legal education, focusing on
              </p>
              <p>Bengaluru Law College stands today as a symbol of excellence in legal education, discipline, and community service, but its journey has been one of steady growth and visionary leadership. The institution was originally established in 2009 as R.K. Law College, with the primary mission of providing affordable and quality legal education to aspiring students. At its inception, the college was guided by the ideals of nurturing legal professionals who would embody the principles of justice, ethics, and service to society.

Recognizing the need to expand its vision and impact, the institution underwent a significant transformation in 2015. Under the stewardship of the Law Wings Educational Trust, the college was restructured and renamed Bengaluru Law College. This marked a turning point in its journey, ushering in a new era of academic innovation, infrastructural development, and broader community engagement. With this transition, the institution strengthened its academic programs, introduced modern teaching methodologies, and created new avenues for student exposure through legal aid clinics, moot courts, seminars, and workshops.

Over the years, Bengaluru Law College has grown into a vibrant hub of learning, where classroom teaching is effectively blended with practical training. Students are encouraged not only to master the black-letter law but also to develop analytical, research, and advocacy skills essential to succeed in the legal profession. Regular internships with law firms, senior advocates, and NGOs further enhance their practical knowledge and career readiness.

The institution flourishes under the inspiring leadership of:

President – Dr. Renuka Raju, who provides strategic vision and academic guidance.

Vice-President – Sri. K. Shailesh Raju, who plays a key role in strengthening governance and student development.

Managing Trustee & Treasurer – Prof. Prasanna V. Raju, who ensures that the institution’s resources and values align with its mission of service and excellence.

Principal – Dr. Devika S. Ajila, who oversees day-to-day academic administration and fosters a nurturing environment for students and faculty alike.

The leadership’s collective vision has enabled Bengaluru Law College to uphold its tradition of academic excellence, ethical learning, and professional discipline, while steadily expanding opportunities for students to grow into well-rounded individuals.

In addition to academics, the college has always emphasized holistic development. Two flagship annual events are a testament to this philosophy:

“Tarang” – the Inter-Class Cultural Competition, which celebrates student creativity and cultural diversity through music, dance, debate, theatre, and literary events.

“Khel” – the Inter-Class Sports Competition, which instills values of teamwork, discipline, resilience, and sportsmanship among students through a variety of indoor and outdoor games.

These events, along with student participation in National Service Scheme (NSS), legal aid camps, and community service programs, reflect the college’s commitment to producing not just lawyers, but socially conscious citizens.

Today, Bengaluru Law College is recognized as a dynamic institution where tradition meets innovation. It continues to produce graduates who are well-prepared to enter the legal profession as advocates, academicians, judges, corporate professionals, and policymakers. Guided by its motto of knowledge, discipline, and justice, the college remains steadfast in its mission to contribute to society by shaping responsible leaders in the field of law.</p>
